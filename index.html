<h5>
Cybersecuirty Student - Programmer</h5>
<p>
  Being a cyber security student, programmer, and gamer is like juggling three high-stakes games at once: you're hacking systems like a ninja, coding like a wizard, and gaming like a proâ€”all while trying not to accidentally delete your thesis with a misclick. Your idea of multitasking is debugging code while strategizing raids and keeping one eye on your cybersecurity alerts like they're incoming boss attacks. It's a life where you speak fluent binary, your keyboard doubles as a drum set during intense gaming sessions, and your idea of a "cheat code" is a well-placed firewall rule.</p>
